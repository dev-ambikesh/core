/**
 * What is "NameSpace"
 * 
 * Php Namespaces provide a way in which to group related classes , interfaces, functions and contants. Namespace are a way of encapsulating  items.
 * 
 * A namespace is like a folder or directory.
 * 
 * In the PHP world, namespaces are designed to solve two problems that authors of libraries and applications encounter when creating re-usable code elements such as classes or functions.
 * 
 * Name collision between code you create, and internal PHP classes/functions/contanst or third-party classes/functions/constants.
 * 
 * *********************
 *   WHY USE NAMESPACE
 * *********************
 * 
 * You can create two or more class with same name  in single file.
 * 
 * you can create two or more class with same name in single file.
 * 
 * You can create two or more constant with same name in single file.
 * 
 * You can avoid Name conflicts while using Third Party Libraries / Framework.
 * 
 * You can seprate Codes.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ===================================================
 *      NAMESPACE NAMING RULES 
 * ===================================================
 * 
 * namespace keyword is used to declare Namespaces in PHP
 * 
 * .Namespace must nne the first statement of the file before any other code . with once exception declare keyword.
 * 
 * 
 * <?php
 * 
 * // Right way
 *  declare(encoding = 'UTF=8' );
 *  namespace Product 
 *  const NUM = 10;
 * 
 * 
 *  // Wrong Way
 *  <html>
 * </html>
 * 
 *  declare(encoding = 'UTF=8' );
 *  namespace Product 
 *  const NUM = 10;
 * 
 * Classes (including abstracts and traits) , interfaces, functions , and contants can be contained within a namespace, only these type of code are affected by namespace.
 * 
 * Namespace names are case-insensitive
 * 
 * Namespace (even nested or sub-namespaces) cannot be just a number , it must start with a letter 
 * Ex :- namespace 12 or namesapce Product/12
 * 
 * Not possible to mix bracketed namesapce declarations with unbracketed namespace declarations. 
 * 
 * Example :-
 * 
 * Laptop.php
 * <?php
 * 
 * declare (encoding = 'UTF');
 * 
 * namespace Product;
 * 
 * 
 *
