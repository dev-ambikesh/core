  <h1>Scope Chain Of Variables and functions</h1>
  <p>
    The scop chain is use to resolve the value of variable name in JavaScript. 
    Scope Chain in JavaScript is "Lexically defind", which means we can see that what the scop chain will be by looking at the code. 
    At the Scope chain is global Scope, which is window object in browser. 
    Lexical Scopping :- a function that is laxically within a function get access to the scop of other function. ( Inner function can get their parent function Variables, but the vice versa is not true ).
