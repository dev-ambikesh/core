   * What is clouser in JavaScript
   * Ans :- Clouser is an action that is inner function can have access to the outer functions variable as well as the global variables.
   * 
   * A clouse is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
   * 
   * [ The return function does not execute the inner function -- function is executed only when followed by () , but rather the return statement of entire body of the function ]
   * */
